# Tinkercad Tasks

This repository contains three basic electronics projects designed using Tinkercad. Each project is described below with a link to its Tinkercad simulation.

## Task 1: LED Blinking

In this task, an LED is programmed to blink at regular intervals. This is a fundamental project for understanding the basics of digital output and timing in microcontroller programming.

- **Project Link:** [Task 1 - LED Blinking](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0WDlSXQgUrR-task-1-led-blinking?sharecode=5YdBrD_R1n0EBFcFwrOWj8qi9Itw5NO-CtN9xAnYzog)

### Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LED
- Resistor
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires


## Task 2: Knight Rider

This task simulates the Knight Rider light effect using multiple LEDs. The LEDs light up in sequence, creating a back-and-forth motion, similar to the lights on the car from the TV show "Knight Rider".

### Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- 8 LEDs
- 8 Resistors
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires



## Task 3: Ultrasonic Sensor

This task uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to an object and display the distance on the serial monitor. It introduces the concept of sensors and analog input in microcontroller programming.

### Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires
