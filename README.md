## Getting Started

To get started with the workshop materials, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IoT-5G-Workshop.git
   cd IoT-5G-Workshop
   ```

2. **Arduino/ESP8266 Setup:**
   - Install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Add the ESP8266 board manager URL in the Arduino IDE preferences.
   - Install the necessary libraries as specified in the code comments.
